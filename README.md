## Overview
In the dynamic landscape of information technology, our group embarked on a comprehensive project to design and implement a robust Small Office Home Office (SOHO) network for AASDJ Foods, a burgeoning company in Lahore, Pakistan. With the vision of expanding its operations, AASDJ Foods sought our expertise to establish an autonomous network for a new branch near the local village of Bonalbo.

This project required meticulous planning and execution to cater to the specific needs of three distinct departments: Admin/IT, Finance/HR, and Customer Service/Reception. Utilizing cutting-edge Cisco technologies, we developed a sophisticated network infrastructure incorporating routers, switches, access points, and a secure wireless communication framework.

## Key Features
- **Network Design:** Comprehensive network planning to accommodate Admin/IT, Finance/HR, and Customer Service/Reception departments.
- **Cisco Technologies:** Utilized advanced Cisco routers, switches, and access points.
- **IP Addressing Scheme:** Implemented a structured IP addressing scheme to ensure efficient resource allocation.
- **DHCP Server Configuration:** Configured DHCP servers to dynamically assign IP addresses.
